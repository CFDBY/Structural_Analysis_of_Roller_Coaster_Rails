# Structural_Analysis_of_Roller_Coaster_Rails
This project investigates roller coaster rail designs using Finite Element Analysis via ANSYS and experimental optimization through the Taguchi Method. The goal is to identify the most structurally efficient rail configuration under different load scenarios.
